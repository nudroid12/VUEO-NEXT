VUEO is a Mobile + Android TV monorepo with `:shared:core` as the reusable logic layer.

Critical rules:

- Search Shared Core before adding reusable logic to Mobile or TV.
- Mobile Player UI is the current canonical Player visual reference. TV adapts it for D-pad and 10-foot use.
- Mobile Settings hierarchy is the current canonical Settings visual reference. TV adapts it for D-pad and 10-foot use.
- `Content Manager` is the official name for addon/provider management.
- Do not reintroduce TV-only hardcoded Cinemeta discovery when Shared Core already provides discovery/meta.
- Do not casually touch stable source ranking/recovery during unrelated UI work.
- Many `mobile/core/...` files are compatibility aliases to Shared Core, not duplicate implementations.
- TV must remain fully D-pad operable with obvious white + scale focus.
- Preserve repository-relative paths in replacement ZIP patches.
- For patch ZIPs containing only module paths such as `tv/`, include root `build.gradle.kts` as a repository-root marker to avoid extraction ambiguity.
